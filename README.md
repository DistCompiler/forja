# Forja Compiler Toolkit

Forja is a tool for building compilers, or other language transformation tools.

This repository is public for collaboration purposes, and makes no promises of completion.
This message will be replaced with links to documentation and such as the prototype gets closer to complete.

Top-level repo guide:
- `src`: the main Forja source code and tests.
- `langs`: languages implementations using Forja.
  Includes the `calc` demo language.
- `scripts`: utilities for maintaining the codebase.

Here are some key types defined in `src`:
- `forja.Node`: a generic AST class inspired by the Trieste project. AST nodes are tagged with Token objects, whose pointer identity makes for easy pattern matching. The structure is mutable, and is designed to have well defined behavior despite this fact (should be hard to create corrupt trees).
- `forja.manip.Manip`: an _applicative functor_ that is used for tree traversal and modification. Manip supports context-passing, backtracking search with commit points, and flatMap for occasions when monadic behavior is needed.
- `forja.manip.SeqPattern`: a wrapper around Manip that handles pattern matching sequences of sibling nodes in an AST. Used with `dsl.on(...)` and `dsl.pass`, patterns let you express rewrite rulesets.
- `forja.source.Source` and `forja.source.SourceRange`: byte-level views over files, wrapping `java.nio` buffers. Contains added Scala sequence syntax, no-copy slicing, line/column number calculation, and source location pretty-printing.
- `forja.wf.Wellformed`: AST specification and validation. You write what your AST should look like in an EBNF-like syntax and it:
  1. will check that syntax for you if you ask, wrapping bad cases in Error nodes. Node has facilities for efficiently detecting Error subtrees and iterating over them.
  2. can serialize your AST to and from s-expressions, either to look at it, or for interchange.

Outside of those notable classes and some utilities, there are 2 important subfolders:

- `forja.sexpr`: facilities for reading and writing S-Expressions. Mostly for use by Wellformed, but tested on a necessary-seeming subset of the original proposed RFC.
- `forja.langs.calc`: demo language and work in progress tutorial for getting to grips with Forja's concepts.
- `forja.langs.tla`: under-construction parser for the TLA+ modeling language, which has been invaluable in stress-testing all the generic machinery. The test suite involves trying to parse the full TLA+ Examples folder.
